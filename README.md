# Project Title: Potato Disease Classification and Prediction

## Project Description:

The **"Potato Disease Classification and Prediction"** project is aimed at developing a machine learning application that can accurately identify and classify various diseases affecting potato plants based on images of their leaves. Potatoes are a staple crop, and diseases like early blight and late blight can significantly impact crop yield and quality. This project harnesses the power of machine learning to assist farmers and agronomists in detecting and managing these diseases at an early stage.

## Key Features:

**Image Classification:** The core feature of this project involves the classification of potato leaf images into three main categories: Early Blight, Late Blight, and Normal Health Plant.

**Model Training:** The project utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn from a labeled dataset of potato leaf images. The model is trained to differentiate between different disease states and healthy plants.

**Prediction**:The trained model is integrated into an interactive web application using the Streamlit framework. Users can upload images of potato leaves to the application, and the model predicts the disease class along with a confidence score.

**User-Friendly Interface:** The Streamlit-based interface offers a user-friendly experience. It allows users, including farmers and agricultural experts, to easily upload images and receive instant predictions without requiring technical expertise.

**Real-World Application:** The project has practical implications in agriculture. Early detection of diseases enables timely interventions and management strategies, potentially saving crops and increasing agricultural productivity.

# Technologies Used:

**TensorFlow and Keras**:
Used for building, training, and deploying the convolutional neural network for image classification.

 **Streamlit:** Employed to create an interactive and user-friendly web application that facilitates image uploading and prediction.

**Python**: The primary programming language for model development, data preprocessing, and application development.

**PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: Used to process and manipulate images in Python.

## Benefits:

**Early Disease Detection:** The project aids in the early detection of diseases affecting potato plants, allowing farmers to take preventive measures before the diseases spread and cause significant damage.

**Improved Crop Management:** Accurate disease classification empowers farmers with information needed for effective crop management, reducing the reliance on indiscriminate pesticide use.

**Accessible Technology:** The web application makes the technology accessible to a wider audience, including small-scale farmers who might not have advanced technical skills.

**Educational Tool:** The project can also serve as an educational tool, raising awareness about potato diseases and their management.



The **"Potato Disease Classification and Prediction"** project is a practical application of machine learning technology that addresses real-world agricultural challenges. It empowers farmers with the tools they need to ensure healthier potato crops, minimize losses, and contribute to sustainable agriculture practices.
